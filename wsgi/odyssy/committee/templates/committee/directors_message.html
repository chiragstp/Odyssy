            <p>
                It gives me great pleasure in taking up the responsibility as Director, IIIT Vadodara. Gujarat is a vibrant state with strong industrial base.
                <br/> I am sure, the industrial base will provide a strong environment to the budding talents. I seek support of all stake holders in steering the institute to a great future.
                <br/>We have lots of work to do in multiple fronts. We have to create quality infrastructure, develop labs for academic and research activities, enhance research potential, expand the academic programs.
                <br/> Enhancement in enrollment to postgraduate studies and research will be a key factor for improving our visibility to the world. We have to achieve all these in the fast changing education system.
                <br/>Let's all work together to achieve these heights.
